                                    I’ve always been good at learning.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I started my journey approximately 4+ years ago.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Selling is an important skill.
                                    ‍<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I was once a huge promoter, to say the least. Back in 2019, when I made my first few
                                    apps. Yup, I was an app developer, making apps related to android customization back
                                    in the day.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I had no audience, nothing. All I had was an app and access to an editing tool
                                    called Pixlr (the only thing I knew back then).I spent tens of hours a week making
                                    visuals promoting my app. Then, I promoted those visuals on multiple subreddits
                                    every single day.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Needless to say, sales were low, making about $50 a month, although I worked 40/50
                                    hours a week.
                                    ‍<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Heck, even working at Mcdonald's would have gotten me $1200/month for lesser mental
                                    effort.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Adding to that, I started getting banned from subreddits. Which means I had to do
                                    something. Fast.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And I decided to start an Instagram account. This led to an increase in sales,
                                    followers, and connections.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So, it’s a good thing, right?
                                    Not really.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was when I realised my true calling wasn’t in android customisation. It was in
                                    design, business, and helping people.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It wasn’t easy to change niches. Because I was worried about what will happen if I
                                    suddenly change my niche.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    ‍Will I stop making money? Will I lose the 5 thousand followers I gained over the
                                    past 2 years? What will my followers think of me if I suddenly change niche? Am I
                                    doing a disservice?
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I didn’t have enough courage to change my niche.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So, I continued in the same niche with less satisfaction. And less effort because I
                                    didn’t like what I was doing. I tried and tried to mix android customisation with my
                                    interests. Spoiler alert: I failed.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But, I didn’t give up. And that’s why I’m here.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Until one day, I had enough. My sales were down. My happiness was down.I took that
                                    leap of faith to change my niche.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    All the things I thought would happen didn’t. Some did, however. This included
                                    lesser followers and sales suddenly plummeting to very little. But, I was relieved.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Like every other human being, I did what was reasonable. And that was to copy
                                    others. I copied what other designers and people in my niche were doing. I did the
                                    same thing as them but worse. Because my skills weren’t as good.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But nevertheless, by running paid ads, engaging, networking, and posting content
                                    (albeit not consistently), I gained a 1000 followers in 3 months.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I started making products, icon packs, apps, UI Kits, design systems, and others.
                                    The most popular one in there was my icon pack which earned me $250/m. And I was
                                    working 60 hours a week. I didn’t know what was wrong.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Until I realised I wasn’t actually doing any work. I was consuming tons of content
                                    and not executing on it.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    How did I realise this? I went overseas for 3 weeks and I only worked for 2 hours a
                                    day instead of the usual 8-10 hours. But, nothing in my business changed. That’s a
                                    wake up call. (Tip: Take a break and get to know yourself)
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I started making systems.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I then set out to write a book. I outlined what I needed to include in that book and
                                    the topics I need to learn. I spent 5 months researching and writing that 200-page
                                    book. But, after I launched it, nothing happened.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The sales I envisioned to come rolling in didn’t.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I just looked desperate instead.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Failing these many times made me feel burnout. I didn’t post or do anything for 3
                                    weeks. It was like a long break.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That break was one of the best things that happened. Because that break made me
                                    realise the good things that happened. The good qualities in me. And the lessons I
                                    learnt from writing that book (which I will outline later for you).
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Looking back, those 5 months were the biggest growth periods of my life. I learnt so
                                    much from writing that book and wanting to make it a good one.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I learnt about marketing, storytelling, copywriting, design, email marketing,
                                    self-improvement, product launch, and much more.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I also recognised the good qualities in myself.
                                    → I was a relentless learner
                                    → I didn’t give up
                                    → I wasn’t afraid of networking with big creators
                                    → I wasn’t afraid of showing up although I wasn’t good
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But I also recognised my shortcomings. I decided to actually start working on my
                                    business. The right way. All the things I learnt till then were put into use. I
                                    started acting. I started executing. (Finally)
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I decided to make 10K by the end of that month. No matter what. Spoiler alert
                                    (again), I didn’t make 10K. But I realised what I needed to do to hit at least 10K.
                                    I learnt a lot during that one month.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Because I made my 6-month goal, a 1-month goal instead. I pushed myself. But it was
                                    worth it.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It was from that month onwards that my growth started increasing. A lot.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    ‍Here are the few things I changed:
                                    ‍→ I started posting content every day (highly recommended)
                                    → I started improving every day
                                    → I built systems to improve my workflow
                                    → I made a calendar for promoting my products
                                    → I joined like-minded communities
                                    → I started networking more
                                    → I pushed myself out of my comfort zone
                                    → I stopped copying what others were doing
                                    → I started focusing on how I can differentiate myself
                                    → I doubled down on what works
                                    → I focused on what sets me apart
                                    → I started creating valuable content - both short-form and long-form
                                    → I created a new piece of content every single day
                                    → I shared things I learnt in a new way
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And most importantly, I didn’t stop improving and iterating.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
